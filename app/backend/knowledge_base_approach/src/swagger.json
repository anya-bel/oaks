  title: FRED API
  description: >
    FRED is a tool for automatically producing RDF/OWL ontologies and linked
    data from natural language sentences. The method is based on Combinatory
    Categorial Grammar, Discourse Representation Theory, Linguistic Frames, and
    Ontology Design Patterns. Results are enriched with NER and WSD.
