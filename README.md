## Abstract
The aim of this project is to develop a software that provides users with a probability value reflecting the likelihood of an inputted news article being fake. To achieve this, a multi-modal pipeline was implemented, by ensembling the results from 4 different modules (rule-based, neural network, cross-checking, and knowledge-base algorithm). The app is accessible to the users through a GUI at [website-domain-pending.fr](website.com).
